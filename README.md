Title : EchoVerse – An AI-Powered Audiobook Creation Tool

Description: EchoVerse is a generative AI-based audiobook creation system that transforms user- provided text into expressive, downloadable audio content. Designed for accessibility, convenience, and content reusability, the tool empowers students, professionals, and visually impaired users to convert written material into natural-sounding narrations with customizable tone and voice. The system accepts either pasted text or uploaded .txt files and displays the original content within the interface. Upon selection of a desired tone—Neutral, Suspenseful, or Inspiring— the text is rewritten using the IBM Watsonx Granite large language model. Prompt chaining is used to ensure the tone-specific rewrite remains faithful to the original meaning while enhancing stylistic quality.

Solution for the problem statement:

Tone-Adaptive Text Rewriting – Rewrites input text into Neutral, Suspenseful, or Inspiring tones using IBM Watsonx LLM, while preserving original meaning and enhancing expressiveness.

High-Quality Voice Narration – Converts rewritten text into natural-sounding audio using IBM Watson Text-to-Speech with selectable voices like Lisa, Michael, or Allison.

Downloadable and Streamable Audio Output – Allows users to listen to audio directly in the app and download the final narration in .mp3 format for offline use.

Side-by-Side Text Comparison – Displays original and tone-adapted text together for easy verification and stylistic comparison.

User-Friendly Local Interface – Provides an intuitive Streamlit-based frontend
